                <h6>Partnerships with Training Providers</h6>
                <p class="desc" style="text-align: left;">We deliver a range of courses in collaboration with leading
                    developers of workplace safety. The OSHA Outreach Courses has collaborated with HSI to
                    provide OSHA-authorized outreach learning. Students who successfully complete OSHA outreach training
                    programs will receive an official OSHA card from the U.S. Ministry of Labour.</p>
                <p class="desc" style="text-align: left;">Outreach courses are notÂ available from any provider to any
                    student residing outside the United States. Students may require a U.S. address for card processing
                    and must be based within the U.S. or certain U.S. territories and commonwealths to fulfill all
                    aspects of OSHA outreach training.</p>
                <p class="desc" style="text-align: left;">For students in locations where OSHA outreach training is not
                    required or approved, OSHA Outreach Courses provides 10-and 30-hour training courses labelled Osha
                    10 Equivalent & Osha 30 Equivalent respectively. These courses are similar in content to the
                    OSHA-authorized instruction, but do not include an official OSHA card upon completion of the
                    course.</p>
                <p class="desc" style="text-align: left;">If you have purchased Equivalent training but are in need of
                    OSHA-authorized training, kindly contact our support team as soon as possible.</p>
